# FFSP_2024_code_data

This repository contains all the code used for the simulations and the data used for validation. For any questions, feel free to email Elena D'Ambrosio at [elena.dambrosio@bsse.ethz.ch](mailto:elena.dambrosio@bsse.ethz.ch). Have a great day!

## Repository Structure

The repository includes a main folder called `FFSP_code_revised_2024`. Inside this folder, you will find several subfolders, each containing code for reproducing specific examples:

- `Non_Linear_Example_intro`
- `Introduction_PF`

These subfolders contain the code for the examples presented in the introduction. Additionally, there are subfolders for reproducing the numerical examples from the Results section of the paper. Each of these folders is named according to the corresponding numerical example in the order of appearance.

Each folder contains a README file to assist you in navigating the code unless the structure is straightforward, in which case a README may not be present.

Enjoy exploring the code!
